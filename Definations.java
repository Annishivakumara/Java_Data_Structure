1. What is Data Structure?
   A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing
   data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively. The main
   idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities.
   An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.

   
 Classification:
  Data structures can be classified into two broad categories:

Linear Data Structure: A data structure in which data elements are arranged 
   sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements,
   is called a linear data structure. Examples are array, stack, queue, etc.

   
Non-linear Data Structure: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or
   linearly are called non-linear data structures. Examples are trees and graphs.
